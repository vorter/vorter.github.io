## About Me

My name is Brandon Hyeung, currently a 3rd year MIS & Music Business student here at UGA, and I was curious if your restaurant was hiring new DJs. 
I've been mixing fraternity and house parties for 2 years now and can adapt to any genre but I specialize in EDM/Electronic.
I have sample mixes and logos/marketing content available as well. 

My mixes are on my Mixcloud linked below. These two specific mixes cover a decent range of genres.

FYI all my uploaded mixes are freestyled with no planning so there will be some audible technical mistakes but for a gig at a bar or venue it would be rehearsed to ensure it's 100% smooth while still being flexible to adapt to the crowd. I also know how to effectively cycle the dancefloor/venue to make breaks for customers to get more drinks.

Much thanks,
